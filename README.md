# My website's source code: ONLIX.ME
## "Why is this not fully 100% updated"?
Most parts of the website still ARE open source! I'm trying to keep this up to date.. somehow
### I don't care
- I'm too dumb to get it to work, because it's annoying with SFTP and Visual Studio Code and Git and everything. It's just not worth the effort.
- As soon as I have the motivation and a solution to automate this, I'll definetely do it.

### I have some files in here that shouldn't be uploaded:
- perhaps I have personal/private data in here like tokens or something
- large files that tage ages to upload, like `/mods/mcc.zip`
- files with **licensing problems**, for example: I have a mirror of Java Runtime Environment 8 in here for my friends to download quickly without wasting time logging into oracle and stuff like that
