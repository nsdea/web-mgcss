# My website's source code: ONLIX.ME
## Why is this not 100% open source?
Most - pretty much **all** PUBLIC parts of the website - ARE definetely open source! If not, then there's a 100% chance I just forgot to push it - in this case, contact me on Discord :) 

Okay, *but what about the closed source parts*, you might ask? Well, they are just private stuff (or testing).

### I have some files in here that shouldn't be uploaded:
- perhaps I have personal/private data in here like tokens or something
- large files that tage ages to upload, like `/mods/mcc.zip`
- files with **licensing problems**, for example: I have a mirror of Java Runtime Environment 8 in here for my friends to download quickly without wasting time logging into oracle and stuff like that
