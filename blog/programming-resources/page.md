# Resources for programmers
Learning & creating awesome projects with the programming language of your choice!

## Documentations
Documentations are more like a detailed overview, usually for more experienced developers. They explain how specific features work and how to implement them into your code/project.

There is a documentation for almost every single API/library out there. Please look the documentation up in the internet, just search for the API/library and "docs" or "documentation".

A popular documentation website is https://readthedocs.org/ with over 55.000.000 pages and 100.000 projects.

Sometimes, the documentation can also be found in the "Wiki" tab of the project's GitHub repository.
